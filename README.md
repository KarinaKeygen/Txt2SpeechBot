Repository for the only Text to Speech Telegram Inline Bot.

This inline bot ([@Txt2SpeechBot](https://t.me/Txt2SpeechBot)) translates your text messages into audios.
It takes the audios from Goole Text To Speech API on a improved way to send them quickly, without downloading them in the VPS.
For more details, you can see the source code.

### Main use

If you want to say "Hello" to somebody, you have to type...

```
@Txt2SpeechBot Hello
```

... in any chat, choose the language and enjoy it :)

### Predifined audios

It also has some predifined audios made for fun.
They will appear every time you type the bot's name without any additional text.
If you would like an audio will be in this menu, don't hesitate to contact me on telegram ([@supremoh](https://t.me/supremoh)).
I will decide if it is suitable for the bot.
